					Analyzing content from the Internet, mainstream media, Facebook, podcasts, and other forums is difficult. Groupthink and propagandization inhibit efforts to ascertain reality. Nascent censorship and metastasis of idealogical frameworks leave the milieu of intellectual discourse impoverished.   
				</p>

				<p>
					At Cult of Ryan the facade of political correctness is eschewed, and societal evolution is viewed in the context of its spiritual bedrock. A siren song calls us to obey the Zeitgeist, however, bowing to it violates autonomy. Forces compel us to embrace virtues enshrined by leaders and institutions. It takes courage to reject these, and wisdom to discern actually beneficial modes of thought and behavior.
				</p>

				<p>
					I extend an invitation: to join a movement of dissidence&#8212;a counterculture obsessed with prosperity, liberty, and charity&#8212;to explore and protect your processes of cognition, and create a bulwark of faith and knowledge able to preserve you through the onslaught of sophisticated delusions that masquerade as self-evident truth.
